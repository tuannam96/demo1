    <h1>Getting Started with Go on app-engine</h1>
      <p>This is a sample Go application deployed to app-engine. It's a reasonably simple app - but a good foundation for understanding how to get the most out of the app-engine platform.</p>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> How this sample app works</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>This app was deployed to app-engine, either using Git or by using <a href="https://github.com/app-engine/go-getting-started">app-engine Button</a> on the repository.</li>

          <li>When app-engine received the source code it used the go tool chain to compile the application along with any vendored dependencies and created a deployable slug.</li>
          <li>The platform then spins up a dyno, a lightweight container that provides an isolated environment in which the slug can be mounted and executed.</li>
          <li>You can scale your app, manage it, and deploy over <a href="https://addons.app-engine.com/">150 add-on services</a>, from the Dashboard or CLI.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"></span> Next Steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are following the <a href="https://devcenter.app-engine.com/articles/getting-started-with-go">Getting Started</a> guide, then please head back to the tutorial and follow the next steps!</li>
        <li>If you deployed this app by deploying the app-engine Button, then in a command line shell, run:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>go get github.com/app-engine/go-getting-started</code> - this will create a local copy of the source code for the app, compile and install the generated executables in <code>$GOPATH/bin</code></li>
          <li><code>cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/app-engine/go-getting-started</code> - change directory into the local source code repository</li>
          <li><code>app-engine git:remote -a &lt;your-app-name&gt;</code> - associate the app-engine app with the repository</li>
          <li>You'll now be set up to run the app locally, or <a href="https://devcenter.app-engine.com/articles/getting-started-with-go#push-local-changes">deploy changes</a> to app-engine</li>
        </ul>

      Please do work through the Getting Started guide, even if you do know how to build such an application. The guide covers the basics of working with app-engine, and will familiarize you with all the concepts you need in order to build and deploy your own apps.
